# This is an elevator.
1. Elevator requests can be made by entering your selection into the console. For example, if you were on the 5th floor and desire to go up, you would enter "5U". Similarly, if you were on the 8th floor and want to go down, "8D" would be your selection.
2. Entering a number such as "4" will place an elevator rider into a queue that will exit on the 4th floor.
3. An input of "Q" will terminate the program after the elevator fulfills all remaining requests. Any unassigned riders still on the elevator will be assigned to exit on the first floor.
4. This elevator is operating in a 12 story building. Any input other than "1" through "12, "1U" through "11U", "2D" through "12D", and "Q" will be thrown out. Also, if there are no unassigned passengers in the elevator, any exit requests ("1"-"12") will be thrown out. Input is not case-sensitive. "u", "d", and "q" are OK to use.
